      Moolah was founded by a group of University students who recognized the
      difficulty in deciding which financial products are truly beneficial for
      them. As such, when given the opportunity to work on a project, they
      decided to create Moolah to facilitate youths in their financial planning
      process. Along the way, many challenges were faced as it was their first
      time working on such a large-scale project. In fact, due to the limited
      financial knowledge that they possess, it made it even tougher. However,
      after much research and hard work, they have finally succeeded in meeting
      their goals. Moolah hopes to provide a platform for youths to make wise
      and informed decisions for themselves.
